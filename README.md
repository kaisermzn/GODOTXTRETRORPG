# GODOTXTRETRORPG

A simple text-based retro RPG console using Godot. The scene contains a basic CRT shader and reacts to two commands:

* `hola` &rarr; prints `hola mundo` in the output area.
* `fuera` &rarr; closes the game.

## Running

Open the project with Godot (tested with Godot 4) and run the `Main` scene.
